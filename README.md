## :rocket: Cool tech
- coded in typescript
- react for frontend, and express for backend
- react bootstrap for styling 
- react icons for some features
- psql for database
- using Regex for checking password strength 
- using google calender api
- using adzuna api for job search
- using Zod, React hook Form for input validation

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- user cant stay logged in when reload(fixed)
- passing state data to unrelated components unsuccessfully(fixed)
- layout is very different between localhost and heroku(cant figure out why and how to solve it yet)
- show password icon in the input field

## :sob: Lessons learnt
manage time better
let go if you cant figure out a few feature, can always come back later
## :white_check_mark: Future features
pagination for job list
